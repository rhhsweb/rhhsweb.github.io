                    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the language used to describe the overall structure of webpages as well as its contents. 
                    In comparison, CSS is used to describe the appearance of webpages and JavaScript is used to control the functionality of webpages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HTML has a fairly long history, dating back to 1993. At the beginning, there was no standard way to display HTML code, meaning websites 
                    would have to be written differently for different browsers. As time went on, web standards were developed and adopted by browsers. Newer 
                    versions of HTML were released, adding new features.

                    All browsers now are capable of running HTML code in more or less the same way. These include Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and more. The most
                    recent version of HTML is HTML5.

                <h2>Elements</h2>
                <p>
                    At its core, HTML is made of <a href="/tutorials/html/lesson-2">elements</a>, which describe and label what a piece of text should be. 
                    For example, the <code class="language-html">&lt;p&gt;</code> element is used to label plaintext and paragraphs.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The structure of webpages arise from the order of elements and the ability to nest different elements together.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;h1&gt;My &lt;i&gt;Three&lt;/i&gt; Favourite Colours&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Red&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Blue&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Yellow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Don't worry if this does not make sense yet. We will learn more about how elements work in the future.
